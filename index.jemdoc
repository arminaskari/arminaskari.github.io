I am a third year Ph.D student in Electrical Engineering \& Computer Science at UC Berkeley advised by [https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~elghaoui/ Laurent El Ghaoui]. Prior to my PhD, I received a B.A. in Applied Mathematics and B.S.c in Mechanical Engineering from UC Berkeley, where I was fortunate to work with [https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Faculty/Homepages/varaiya.html Pravin Varaiya] and the late [https://me.berkeley.edu/news/andy-packard-professor-pioneer-in-robust-control-systems-and-beloved-teacher-1960-2019/ Andy Packard]. I had also spent some time working at the University of Toronto Institute for Aerospace Studies with [https://www.utias.utoronto.ca/research/computational-aerodynamics/ David Zingg].
